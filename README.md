Hi, Welcome to my final project exam!

This is an updated edition of what I delivered for review, but i think it's looking really good. 

The things I have edited: 

1. Removed the home page. On my exam brief we were told to make a home page with a slider to feature some of our products. I still have the home.jsx file in my project, but I have not included it on the page. I did this because I wanted to make this page to feel a bit exclusive. 

2. I have added used a different API because the one I originally had, have been deleted. The API I am currently using is a Noroff API which is free to use. 

3. I have added Firebase to deal with my authentication on this project. I have worked with Firebase on a couple of other side-projects of mine and I really like it. I feel like it is easy to use and provides a very good authentication to the page. 

4. I have made a few minor design changes. 

This app is created with React.js. I have used React.js in many of my previous projects and I really love to work with this framework.

I really hope you like this page as much as I do.
